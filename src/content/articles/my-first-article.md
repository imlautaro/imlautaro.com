title: Woohoo! This is my very first blog post
---

Hey, I'm starting a blog and I'm so excited because now I'll be able to share with people whatever I want, whenever I want. And that's amazing.

But in fact, this could already be done through some social network. So, what is special or different about starting a blog? Well, the thing is that it's not just about sharing things, but it's also like a challenge for myself; a way of learning something new; I'll have full control of everything here; and most importantly, it's gonna be more fun and interesting :)

And by the way, I have no experience in writing and I don't have a very advanced level of English either, but I'll do my best to improve every single day.
